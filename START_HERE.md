## 🎯 What This Pipeline Does

### ✅ Continuous Integration
- **Automatically runs** on every push and pull request
- **Installs dependencies** for your project
- **Lints code** to maintain quality standards
- **Runs tests** to catch bugs early
- **Builds project** to verify it compiles

### 🚀 Continuous Deployment
- **Automatically deploys** when code merges to main
- **Only deploys** if all tests pass
- **Supports** Vercel, AWS, Heroku, and more

### 🛡️ Access Control
- **Two allowed users** can push directly (optional)
- **Two restricted users** must create pull requests
- **Code owners** must approve all changes
- **Branch protection** prevents unauthorized changes
- **Required reviews** enforce code quality

### 🏷️ Automation
- **Auto-labels** pull requests by size and content
- **Auto-requests** reviews from appropriate users
- **Auto-deletes** branches after merge
- **Status badges** show build status

---

## ✅ READY TO PUSH - Usernames Configured!

### Configured Team Members:

**Owners (Direct Push Access):**
- [@subham2023](https://github.com/subham2023) - Main Owner
- [@sidhyaashu](https://github.com/sidhyaashu) - Second Owner

**Contributors (PR Required):**
- [@Abhishek-Royy](https://github.com/Abhishek-Royy) - Restricted User
- [@Sayandip05](https://github.com/Sayandip05) - Restricted User

All placeholders have been replaced! You can proceed to customize and push.

### 2. Customize for Your Tech Stack (2 minutes)

**If you have Node.js/JavaScript:**
- Open `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- Uncomment Node.js sections (lines with `# if: hashFiles('package.json')`)

**If you have Python:**
- Open `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- Uncomment Python sections (lines with `# if: hashFiles('requirements.txt')`)

**Other languages:**
- See [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) for examples

## 🚀 After You Push - GitHub Configuration

After pushing to GitHub, you MUST:

1. **Enable branch protection** on `main` branch
2. **Add collaborators** with correct permissions
3. **Add deployment secrets** (if deploying)

📖 **Step-by-step instructions:** [`ACTION_CHECKLIST.md`](ACTION_CHECKLIST.md) Task 6-10

## 🎬 Getting Started (Right Now!)

### Step 1: ✅ Placeholders Already Replaced!
All team members are configured:
- Main Owner: @subham2023
- Second Owner: @sidhyaashu
- Restricted Users: @Abhishek-Royy, @Sayandip05

### Step 2: Customize CI/CD
```bash
# Open and uncomment sections for your tech stack:
.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline with configured team"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/subham2023/client-360.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Configure Branch Protection
```
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Settings → Branches
3. Add protection rule for 'main'
4. Follow SETUP.md Step 4 for details
```

### Step 5: Test Everything
```bash
# Create test branch and PR
git checkout -b test/pipeline
echo "test" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "Test CI/CD"
git push origin test/pipeline

# Open PR on GitHub and verify CI/CD runs
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

- ✅ CI/CD runs automatically on push
- ✅ Pull requests get labeled automatically
- ✅ Restricted users cannot push to main directly
- ✅ Code owner approval is required
- ✅ All tests must pass before merge
- ✅ Deployment happens after merge to main

---

## 🎯 Priority Actions

### 🔴 Must Do (Before Push):
1. Replace usernames in `.github/CODEOWNERS`
2. Replace usernames in `.github/workflows/pr-labeler.yml`
3. Customize `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` for your tech stack

### 🟡 Must Do (After Push):
4. Configure branch protection rules
5. Add collaborators to repository
6. Test the pipeline with a PR

### 🟢 Should Do (Optional):
7. Add deployment secrets
8. Customize PR labels
9. Add badges to README
10. Update README with actual usernames

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Issues:

**"CI/CD not running"**
→ Check `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` is in correct directory
→ Verify YAML syntax is valid

**"Can't find status checks"**
→ Wait for first workflow to complete
→ Then they'll appear in branch protection settings

**"Everyone can push to main"**
→ Verify branch protection rules are saved
→ Check "Do not allow bypassing" is enabled

**"Code owners not working"**
→ Ensure usernames have @ symbol in CODEOWNERS
→ Verify "Require review from Code Owners" is enabled
