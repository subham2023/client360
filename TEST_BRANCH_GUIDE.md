## 📋 **Test Branch Workflow**

### **Daily Development:**
```bash
# Start your day
git checkout test
git pull origin test

# Work on features
# ... make changes ...

# Push anytime
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Working on new feature"
git push origin test
```

### **When Ready for Production:**
```bash
# Create proper PR from test to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  # Pick specific commits
# Or merge test branch
git merge test
git push origin feature/my-feature
# Create PR on GitHub
```

---

## 🛡️ **Safety Guidelines**

### **✅ Safe to Do on Test Branch:**
- Experiment with new features
- Test bug fixes
- Practice Git commands
- Share work-in-progress
- Try different approaches
- Test CI/CD locally

### **⚠️ Be Careful:**
- Don't push sensitive data (passwords, keys)
- Don't push large files unnecessarily
- Communicate with team about major changes
- Don't break the branch for others

### **❌ Never Do:**
- Push to `main` directly (unless you're an owner)
- Delete the test branch
- Force push without warning team
- Push malicious code

## 👥 **Team Collaboration**

### **Sharing Work:**
```bash
# Push your work
git push origin test

# Tell team: "Check out my changes on test branch"
# Team can pull and see your work
git pull origin test
```

### **Merging Work:**
```bash
# If you like someone's work on test branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/their-feature
git cherry-pick <their-commit-hash>
# Create PR to main
```

---

## 🔄 **Branch Management**

### **Keep Test Branch Clean:**
```bash
# Periodically clean up test branch
git checkout test
git pull origin test

# Reset to main (removes all test changes)
git reset --hard origin/main
git push --force-with-lease origin test

# Or merge main into test (keeps test changes)
git merge origin/main
git push origin test
```

### **Sync with Main:**
```bash
# Get latest main changes into test
git checkout test
git merge origin/main
git push origin test
```
